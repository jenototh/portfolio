### [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/jenototh/portfolio/blob/main/university-projects/theses/msc_thesis_no_appendix.pdf)

My Masterâ€™s thesis focused on how AI generated images affect the believability of news headlines. At CBS's NeuroLab we examined the potential negative externalities of new AI technologies in an experimental setting, with a focus on political biases. Preliminary findings were presented at the NeuroIS Retreat 2024 in Vienna, and published [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-71385-9_4). From the experiments, both survey data concerning the answers and neurophysiological data from tracking devices was collected. Using R, the data was cleaned and a number of ANOVA tests were conducted to see the effects of specific variables.


### [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/jenototh/portfolio/blob/main/university-projects/theses/bsc_thesis.pdf)

My Bachelor's Thesis was a qualitative study examinig the changes in stock markets with the prominence of automated trading. The thesis provided an overview over the past decades, seeing how the landscape changed with new technologies. Household investors' returns were examined and the fallacy of the relationship between lower costs of investing and lower stock returns was analyzed using behavioral economics.

After putting the training data (found on https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN) in the correct folder, you can run the code to train all 4 baseline models and all models with 100,000 iterations for Experiment 1 and 2. You need to manually change the code for each model training chunk in "epoch_num = int(100000 / len(train_inputs_001)) + 1" from 100000 to 500000 in order to generate the other models

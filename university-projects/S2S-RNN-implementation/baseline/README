EXP1:
Begin by selecting an architecture (overall best / task specific best) at the top of Exp1/experiment1.ipynb
Then simply run experiment1.ipynb.

EXP2:
Begin by selecting an architecture (overall best / task specific best) at the top of exp2.ipynb
Then simply run exp2.ipynb five times.

EXP3:
Run Exp3/full_lstm_training.ipynb for the LTURN-specific models and Exp3/full_gru_training.ipynb for the JUMP-specific models.
